# Canon in D

This is my second fully open-source animation project.
The first is: https://github.com/gmlewis/dance-of-the-sugar-plum-fairy

The full animation can be viewed on YouTube:
TBD

I used the following tools:

1. Bitwig Studio 5.3.13
2. Blender 5.0
3. VSCode with GitHub Copilot + GPT-5.1-Codex

# Background

I started this project while watching Polyfjord's excellent Audio Visualizer
Masterclass: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amJKrcopZ8A

As I was working on it, I realized that instead of using Wavefront OBJ
files as an intermediary, I could have Copilot help me write Python script
to first parse standardized "*.dawproject" files and dump JSON data, then
further help me write Blender Python files to load the JSON data and create
objects, lights, materials, and animation directly within Blender.

Canon in D was written by Johan Pachelbel and arranged by lemontart.
